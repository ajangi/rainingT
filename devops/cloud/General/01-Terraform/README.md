# Terraform

### What it is?
- The best `IAC`(Infra As Code) software out there
- Developed by Hashicorp with Go, and it is easy to install
- Used `HCL` instead of `yaml` or `json` and this is one of advantages of it over `cloudformation`(AWS)
- Huge community for fixing and implementing new features and services
- It is used to configure almost all infrastructure while cloudformation is used only for AWS
- `Chef` and `Puppet`, are different, they are designed to configure software that is running on machine not machine itself
