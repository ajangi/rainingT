## Acceptance testing
> Final round before production ðŸŒœ

User Acceptance Testing (UAT) is a type of testing performed by the `End user` or the `Client` to verify/accept the software system before moving the software application to the production environment. UAT is done in the final phase of testing after functional, integration and system testing is done.
