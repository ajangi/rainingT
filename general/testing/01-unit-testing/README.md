## Unit testing
> Every developer must know and use ðŸ’» ðŸŽ®

Unit testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.

1. Unit tests help to fix bugs early in the development cycle and save costs. 
2. It helps the developers to understand the testing code base and enables them to make changes quickly 
3. Good unit tests serve as project documentation 
4. Unit tests help with code re-use. Migrate both your code and your tests to your new project. Tweak the code until the tests run again.

### Test Driven Development (TDD) & Unit Testing
Unit testing in TDD involves an extensive use of testing frameworks. A unit test framework is used in order to create automated unit tests. Unit testing frameworks are not unique to TDD, but they are essential to it. Below we look at some of what TDD brings to the world of unit testing:

- Tests are written before the code
- Rely heavily on testing frameworks
- All classes in the applications are tested
- Quick and easy integration is made possible
